### In the recent animal study, the complete data set for 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) was used to analyze and compare the performance of the drug of interest Capomulin versus the other treatment regiment The time to observe and measure tumor development was 45 days.
### The data for one mouse found with duplicate timepoints were removed, the final count of mice was 248.

### The observations made based on the results obtained are as followed:


### 1.	From Summary Statistics for the drug Capomulin the average of tumor volume was 40.67 mm³ which is the second lowest volume. Ramicane was the best performing drug with 40.21mm³of the average tumor volume. Ramicane has the best performance from the all the drug regiments tested (median = 40.67. standard deviation = 4.84). Capomulin has the second best performance (median = 41.55 and standard deviation 4.99). All the other drugs finished with values for the average volume tumor above 50 mm³ (with the worst performance for Ketapril 55.23mm³, and Naftisol 54.33 mm³).

### 2.	There was approximately the same number of male mice (50.4%) and female mice (49.6%) tested. For the drug Capomulin there was the highest number of timepoints for mice tested reached – 230, followed by Ramicane with 228 timepoints, it means for the whole period of the test (45 days) most mice were able to survive through the whole period of testing. On the bottom of this measure were drugs Infubinol – 178 timepoints, Ceftamin – 178 timepoints and Propriva – 148 timepoints.

### 3.	A closer look was performed for data obtained for drugs Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. According to the Interquartile range (IRQ)calculation which measured the spread of the middle of 50%value in the dataset, the smallest IRQ is for the drug Capomulin 7.78 (lower quartile Q1 = 32.37, upper quartile Q3-=40.15). Ramicane had IQR 9.09 (with lower quartile Q1 = 31.56, upper quartile Q3-= 40.65). For Infubinol and Ceftamin the IRQ value is higher (11.47- Infubinol and 15.57 – Ceftamin), which means the data in the dataset is spread wider
